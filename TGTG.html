          <br>
          One of the leading causes of global warming is overproduction, which is the act of producing more of an item than wanted or needed. This is a big problem as all the unused commodities fill up landfills and the extra material used to create that item would pollute the Earth with toxic chemicals. In fact, overproduction in food has been an immense problem as 30 to 40 percent of the food grown in the United States is wasted, according to the USDA. Two app developers, Lucie Basch and Jamie Crummie decided to combat these problems by creating their mobile app, <a href="https://www.toogoodtogo.com/en-us">Too Good To Go(TGTG)</a>. The app works by partnering with restaurants and grocery stores all over the country to sell their unsold goods that would have been thrown out at the end of the day for a much cheaper price. Because it is impossible to predict which items would be left over, the goods come as a surprise, which contributes to the fun of ordering food from the app. Additionally, the food is also sold at a much cheaper price, which makes this app both convenient and pleasurable. To accommodate the store’s closing time, the products must be picked up within a certain time window. I am recommending two nearby stores that students can order from with reasonable pickup times and scrumptious food. 
          <br><br>

          <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>&nbsp;<b>Eli's Essentials - 1270 Madison Avenue</b>
          <br>
          Time - 5:15 PM to 6:00 PM
          <br>
          Price - $5.99
          <br>
          My Rating - 5 out of 5 stars
          <br><br>
          
          Personally, I have visited this store on multiple occasions and have been impressed by the baked goods every single time. The price was reasonable, the location was perfect, and the food did not taste stale, even though they are leftovers from the end of the day. It will never be boring to order there, as the goods vary every time, and the staff always gives a generous amount of pastries. With the Too Good To Go app, Eli’s usually gives four or five baked goods, which is a very good deal, considering that it only costs six dollars, and the original value for all these goods is about eighteen dollars. Not only does one save money from ordering via TGTG, they benefit the environment as well! Ordering at Eli’s is a great choice if you have any after school activities near Spence, and could serve as the perfect treat after a grueling basketball practice or choir rehearsal. Also, make sure to order the day before or the morning of, as there are a limited number of orders available. Bon appetit!  
          
          <br><br>
          <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>&nbsp;<b> Noglu - 1260 Madison Avenue</b>
          <br>
          Time - 2pm to 5pm
          <br>
          Price - $5.99
          <br>
          My Rating - 4 out of 5 stars
          <br><br>
          
          Just like Eli's, I have visited Noglu several times. For those orders, I only received muffins, which is a bonus for all the muffin-lovers at Spence. The predictability of Noglu’s TGTG orders are part of its charm and the fact that it’s entirely gluten free makes it appealing and accessible to customers. Along with this, the store’s staff gives a bountiful amount of goods(around four to six items), and they are priced fairly considering that they would’ve cost eighteen dollars normally. The location is also very convenient as Spence students only need to walk one block to reach their destination. In fact, many could pick up their orders on their way back home! Along with this, the pickup time  is also favorable, as it provides a lot of leeway and is flexible to all students. For example, students who have a free last period and ones who are staying late after school could both get treats from the store. Personally, I would rate this store a four out of five stars because I am not a huge fan of muffins, but it is guaranteed that those who do will adore getting TGTG from here. Too Good to Go is greatly helping the world with food waste?, while also treating its customers to a well deserved snack.
