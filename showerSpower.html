          Here at Spence, each student undoubtedly possesses a unique perspective and strong sense of self. Spence students are known to be independent, determined, self-sufficient characters who dive headfirst into contention and differences of opinion. For me, that starts in the shower. 
          <br><br>
          Over the last few months, I've had multiple discussions with groups of friends and family about what their showers actually consist of. The level of controversy and conversation that this topic sparked took me by surprise, and made me realize that there is much to be considered and unpacked in each individual’s salubrious practices. 
          <br><br>
          Personal hygiene is a matter that, hopefully, everyone in our community takes very seriously. Curious about the endless possible chronological combinations of shampoo, conditioner, soap, face wash, and any other products one chooses to riddle their routine with, I interviewed a few Spence students to get a better sense of their hygienic agendas. 
          <br><br> 
          Camille Mendez '25 compares her shower routine to the well-known math acronym, PEMDAS. “That's just how I operate,” she shares. Cami is a committed dancer and performer, and showers immediately after her evening rehearsals. Although she staunchly identifies as an evening showerer, Mendez recognizes occasional morning showers as a method of rejuvenation - typically on the weekends. She begins her shower with body wash, stating that it just “feels natural” to cleanse her body before she tends to her hair. She then applies her shampoo and washes it out, following with conditioner. Cami even possesses the ability to clip her still-conditioned hair back with a claw clip - a feat that requires utmost patience and care. She completes the remainder of her shower exigencies while continuing to let the conditioner set in, such as washing her face and shaving. Finally, she rinses out her conditioner. Camille has also requested it be mentioned that she makes a conscious effort to wash her feet as part of her daily showers.  
          <br><br>
          Sophomore Ada Liberson begins her showers with scalp exfoliant. She astutely points out that an important aspect of this step is to “really exfoliate.” Once she washes out the aforementioned exfoliant, she applies her shampoo which she lets sit for approximately five minutes while she applies her body wash. Taking a pause from hair care, Liberson then washes her face. Her final step is conditioner, which may seem like a rather self-explanatory element of Ada’s ritual. However, being the environmentally-conscious Spence student that she is, Ada turns off the water as she combs her conditioner through her hair. She completes her shower by turning the water back on and rinsing out the conditioner.
          <br><br>
          Amanda Wopschall '24 shares both the physical and emotional components of her shower ritual. She provides a detailed run-down of her shampoo routine: “I do all my shampoo stuff. It’s very quick.” If you’re on the edge of your seat, so was I, because apparently, “the bulk of [her] shower comes post-shampoo.” The conditioner segment of Wopschall’s typical shower includes shaving, exfoliating, face-washing, soap, and “stuff like that,” as she completes each of these requirements while her conditioner sets in. The chronological order of these steps, however, “really depends on [her] mood.” Amanda discloses that she prefers to complete the “harder things” first, because if she gets the “easier” parts of her shower out of the way initially, she won’t be motivated to “keep going.”  Interesting insights, Amanda! Incorporating the knowledge she acquired from a 12-year-old’s “glow up in 2 weeks” Tik Tok page, Amanda moisturizes her face immediately after she showers while her “pores are still open and accepting of product.” She then moisturizes her body in order to achieve “pristine, clean legs.” She also brushes her hair and her teeth right after showering, even if it’s the middle of the day! 
          <br><br>
          Showers are deeply personal, profoundly intimate experiences. Serving as anything from daily doses of “me-time” to methods of de-stressing to performances of your entire Spotify playlist into your shampoo bottle (maybe that one’s just me), showers can align with one’s purpose and perspective. Understanding someone’s else’s shower routine is like opening up their soul and having a peek inside; it doesn’t get much more real than this.
