        First, a confession: my 2023 reading list was heavily disappointing. While I did read 30 books over the course of the year, I found very few of those books truly interesting– moreover, the intense workload that comes with junior year at Spence has led me to start squandering my precious pre-bed reading time: wasting that time by instead scrolling through my phone, or, simply going to bed. While I do appreciate getting rest, I’m hopeful that I will find more time to read during the rest of the year, and that these reads will be more exciting than last year’s. Behold is a list of five books I would like to read by the end of this year, my last full calendar year at Spence!

        <b>1. Homegoing by Yaa  Gyasi</b>
         <br>
         <br>
         Back in 2020, my mom lent me her copy of Transcendent Kingdom, Gyasi’s second novel, and I absolutely loved it. Gyasi’s writing paints a painfully clear picture of a Ghanaian family plagued by grief and addiction while struggling to find their footing in the United States. Her first novel, Homegoing, focuses on the relationship that the descendants of two Ghanian sisters have with both the United States and Ghana– the two countries themselves with a relationship that is deeply rooted in enslavement and colonialism. I’m interested to see how Gyasi frames the process of “homegoing”, a counter to the common theme of “homecoming”.

       <b> 2. Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy </b>
        <br>
        <br>
        This one might sound strange- BUT, I decided to read Madame Bovary in November, and I found it absolutely devastating, in the best way possible. After finishing the book, I looked up “if you liked Madame Bovary” on Goodreads, and I was given the choice of Anna Karenina or Crime and Punishment. I purchased Anna Karenina, mainly because I can’t wait to engage with another novel about another woman in high-class European society– Emma’s story in Madame Bovary truly struck me, and I’m looking forward to Anna Karenina. The only thing keeping me from starting Anna Karenina is the book’s length– however, I am hopeful that, as I become more interested in the story, its length will become a mere afterthought.

        <b> 3. Feel Free: Essays by Zadie Smith</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Zadie Smith has no trouble attacking concepts that seem untouchable to many– rather, in her fiction, she carefully weaves together narratives of race and class, to craft stories that are authentic and meaningful. Having read On Beauty over the summer, when I saw Feel Free in a bookstore over spring break, I was immediately drawn in. Feel Free, published in 2018, compiles Smith’s personal essays, political writings, and cultural criticisms to create a fascinating collection of her opinions. After reading Smith’s essay “Fascinated to Presume: in Defense of Fiction” last semester, I am looking forward to engaging with more of her argumentative writing.

       <b> 3. Feel Free: Essays by Zadie Smith</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Lily Gladstone made history when she became the first Indigenous woman to be nominated for the Oscar of Best Leading Actress, and the first Indigenous woman to win a golden globe in the role of leading actress. I’ve been meaning to see the movie, but, before I can see the movie, I have to read the book: Scorsese’s Killers of The Flower Moon was adapted from David Grann’s bestselling novel by the same title, about the Osage murders: a series of tragic killings from 1910-1930, where 24 members of Oklaholma’s Osage tribe were killed. The killings were motivated by greed: the Osage tribe had had immense success in gaining revenue from the oil on their land, and Osage tribe members quickly became targets of thieves around the country. Not only is Killers of the Flower Moon a suspenseful and true story, but it serves as an invaluable reminder of the tragedies that indigenous Americans have been exposed to since the beginning of European colonialism.

        <b>5. Strike Sparks, by Sharon Olds</b>
        <br>
        <br>

        Taking Ms. Silva's Studies in Poetry class this past fall exposed me to writings in forms that I will never forget– while poetry has become a divisive topic among my friends and me, I am always in support of poetry: poetry is the perfect way to appreciate the smaller things in life. Since the start of my poetry class, I have made it my mission to read at least one poetry collection every month– in addition to the novels I read. Olds, whose poetry I had the chance to explore during the fall semester, was the New York State poet laureate from 1998-2000. Strike Sparks is a collection of Olds’ most prized poems, written from 1980-2000. What draws me to Olds’ writing is her examination of family: she is unafraid to write about family dynamics, and to delve deeply into the nature of family life.
