      Did you know that disposing of certain types of electronics or devices with trash or recycling is illegal in New York City? 
      <br><br>
      As some types of electronics have harmful or even toxic materials that can negatively impact the environment it is important to know how to properly get rid of electronic waste or “e-Waste”. 
      <br><br>
      According to the NYC Department of Sanitation website the following items are considered e-Waste: 
      <br><br>
      <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> computers - towers, laptops, small servers
      <br>
      <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> computer accessories - keyboards, mice, monitors, printers, fax machines, external hard drives
      <br>
      <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> television equipment - TVs, VCRs, DVD players, DVRs, cable boxes
      <br>
      <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> portable electronics - cell phones, e-readers, tablets, digital music players
      <br>
      <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> home electronics - video game consoles, virtual reality headsets, digital picture frames
      <br><br>
      As residents of NYC, you can recycle or dispose of your eWaste in an environmentally friendly manner at various locations. Some options include:
      <br><br>
      <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Manufacturers Programs - Of course it is always a good idea to check the brand’s website first, but be aware that many acceptance programs exist for consumers. 
      <br>
      <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>Lower East Side (LES) Ecology Center - Started in 2003, this e-Waste reuse and recycling program has actually eliminated over 10.5 million pounds of electronics from landfills. Electronics recycling and collection events are frequently hosted all over NYC for both working and non-working equipment or devices. 
      <br>
      <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>SAFE Disposal events - Disposal events are held for NYC residents from 10 AM until 4 PM a few times per month at various locations in all five boroughs.

      Keep our environment clean and green!
