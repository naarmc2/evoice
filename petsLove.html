          <br>
          For those of you who have pets, have you ever pet them and felt a little warm feeling in your heart? Whether we acknowledge it or not, there’s been special moments with our pets that are parallel to human relationships. Some can even say that the bond that we have with our pets is like having our child. At times I’ve found myself holding my cat like a baby, cradling her and hearing her purr, and that's okay! Research shows that animals can share a depth of emotion and social interaction. Although animals aren’t able to speak with us, they’re able to communicate love in their special way. Pets can pay attention to the feelings and emotions we feel subconsciously, and can show compassion to their owners. For us, they help us be in the moment, and learn to appreciate small details. With that being said here are some things animals can teach us about love:

          <br><br>  
          <b>1. Forgiveness</b>
          <br>
          A lot of us tend to hold onto grudges with others, whether it be something minor or a major deal to us. How many times have you had to discipline your pet or scold them for something they accidentally did? Through their day-to-day decisions such as learning tricks, or maybe hunting, it’s shown they have an excellent memory. Regardless of how much they remember or suffer, pets choose to love in many situations and continue with life

          <br><br>
         <b>2.  Not caring about what's wrong or right</b>
          <br>
          Going back to loving regardless of the situation, many pets don't overthink or go back to past situations. In life, what matters most is what’s happening at the moment. For me, caring for my pet, and checking up on her silly antics has helped me stay present with the joys of now. By doing so we allow ourselves to let go of our attachment to pride and self-importance. 

          <br><br>
          <b> 3. Unrestrained Affection</b>
          <br>
          With our pets, they never hesitate to give us love, from the moment we come back home to the moment we fall asleep, they’re always there for support. They happily nuzzle, or maybe bark as a fun way to say “hello!”. They take opportunities to show their love, whether it’s by sitting in comfortable silence or just following you around. Pets truly couldn’t care about who they love, but what they do know is that when you love someone, you accept them for who they are. When there are so many social niceties, it can be easy to forget how important physical connection can be for our mental health.

          <br><br>
          Maybe give your pet a little hug or treat to show them the same love they have for us. All this and more shows us how love can be felt and expressed even without words. As you give love to others, remember that your lessons in sharing love can come from the giving nature of your pets!
