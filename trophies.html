         It's the end of spring break. You're lounging around, enjoying your last bits of freedom before jumping into the hefty academic workload you were able to ignore for the past two weeks. The mindset switch from relaxation to concentration is inevitable, but the change is easier said than done if you’re like me. Admittedly, the transition between a break and school has been a rocky road for me. Between my severely altered sleep schedule, my tendency to take the lazy route in any situation, and my extreme social media use, it’s hard to change patterns that have stuck with me throughout my entire life. However, through my years at Spence, I have created tricks to make the shift smoother. Hopefully, these tips will be as helpful to you as they are to me.

         <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> <b>1. Set screen time limits for yourself</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Setting screen time limits for myself during school weeks has been the most beneficial step in reducing my time scrolling through social media (easier said than done). If you were gifted strong willpower, the built-in screen time limit feature on your iPhone puts fundamental app limitations and barriers on your devices. However, these functions have their flaws. If you set up screen time limits on your own, you can easily enter a password to bypass the parameters you’ve constructed. If you lack a strong sense of self-control, I recommend using an app called Opal to control your screen time. Instead of only a password being required to go around screen time controls, the tedious process of opening the app, editing its settings, and entering a password prevents one from immediately ignoring app limits. More generally, screentime limits hold me accountable for how much time I spend on social media and help me productively manage my time on my phone.

        <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> <b> 2. Use a planner</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        If you don’t already use a planner, it’s time to start. Planners can be digital or physical: Your choice depends on what works best for you. Regardless of your selection, a planner  significantly helps with time management. I am often forgetful of commitments and daily tasks ,  so I use a digital planner that gives reminders of the events I am required to attend. As soon as I am verbally told about  a task I must complete, an assignment due, or a test I need to take, I add it to my planner. This system helps with organization skills and allows for sufficient time allotted to each activity. There are numerous digital planner apps available free of charge and physical planners can be found anywhere from Amazon to Staples. Using a planner helps you manage your time efficiently and creates a concrete sense of structure in your daily life. Writing down tasks has been shown to improve cognitive ability, and seeing all my daily tasks in one place increases my motivation to get work done.

        <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> <b>3. Designate a personal study time (stop procrastinating!)</b>        
        <br>
        <br>
        Towards the end of the school year, both academic and extracurricular schedules get packed. From managing sports and other after-school activities to finding enough time to study for tests and other final assignments, stress can quickly grow. After spring break starts, more frees may be available within your schedule. If so, choose one of those frees to specifically make for studying. Designating a time for completing work can enforce a balanced routine, and the problem of procrastination will be tackled one step at a time. If all your free periods during the school day are taken, choose a time after school to get work done at least twice a week. Before implementing these times into my schedule, I found it difficult to finish work without staying up extremely late. However, implementing these specific study times have allowed me to become more productive while studying.
        <br>
        <br>
        The months following spring break are the perfect time to implement new work habits into your life. You can see how the changes work for you and decide if you want to incorporate them into your school routine for the following year. After years of disorganization, these tasks have worked best for me and hopefully can benefit others, too. Good luck!
