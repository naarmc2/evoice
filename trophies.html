         It's the end of spring break. You're lounging around, enjoying your last bits of freedom before jumping into the hefty academic workload you were able to ignore for the past two weeks. The mindset switch from relaxation to concentration is inevitable, but the change is easier said than done if you’re like me. Admittedly, the transition between a break and school has been a rocky road for me. Between my severely altered sleep schedule, my tendency to take the lazy route in any situation, and my extreme social media use, it’s hard to change patterns that have stuck with me throughout my entire life. However, through my years at Spence, I have created tricks to make the shift smoother. Hopefully, these tips will be as helpful to you as they are to me.

        The S'Well water bottle company, founded in 2010, catapulted to popularity for their signature design called “The Original Bottle” in 2015. Before the creation of S’Well, water bottles were primarily made of plastic, taking hundreds of years to decompose. S’Well soon became a trailblazer in reusable water bottles. Additionally, this 17 ounce water bottle was also one of the first water bottles to turn our daily hydration tools into fashion accessories. With its sleek design, it makes drinking water fun and attractive to its users. This was my personal favorite water bottle growing up, and I remember eight-year-old me begging my mom to get it. I would bring it with me everywhere. From going to school to skating practices, its insulation and stylish design has made it my ideal water bottle.

        The year 2020 arrived and with it, the Covid breakdown and the momentous rise of TikTok. One of the first major trends that came from the social media app was the “VSCO girl.” This phrase describes someone  who is influenced by the VSCO photo editing app, signified through having a beachy, carefree vibe, and of course, sporting a Hydroflask. These 20 ounce water bottles are arguably one of the first water bottles to be viral via the internet, marking a new era of social media marketing.

        <br>
        <br>
        As one might have noticed throughout this article, water bottles have gotten larger throughout time, and Stanley is no exception. The Stanley Quencher, holding a whopping 40 ounces, is omnipresent today, reflecting the growing emphasis on hydration. The straw encourages more water intake, and the design – a sleek solid-colored metal water bottle with a convenient handle – makes the quencher stylish to carry around. The consumer market’s positive response to Stanley is evident by a surge in various accessories, especially their straw covers; From whimsical flower designs to playful ice cream motifs, these covers not only protect the straw but also provide a personalized touch to the quencher. Just walking around in Spence, I notice many students sporting Stanley quenchers. Their prevalence among tweens/teenagers highlights how the act of drinking water has evolved into a fashionable and encouraged endeavor. Carrying a personalized and trendy water bottle such as Stanley becomes a fashion statement, reflecting the fusion of utility and aesthetics in the young generation's hydration solutions.
