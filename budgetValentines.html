        As I peer through windows to study menus at my favorite Upper East Side restaurants I notice that the vast majority have altered their offerings for February 14th. Gone is the regular a la carte menu, replaced with a prix fixe display of “specials.” Many of these holiday menus boast three courses for steep prices. And, come February 15th, the regular menu will return with more familiar pricing. All of this has made me realize it may be better to forgo the restaurant experience in favor of more cost effective NYC experiences out in nature this Valentine’s Day. Some holiday ideas for you to consider include:

        <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> <a href="https://siferry.com/">Staten Island Ferry</a>
        <br>
        You can experience what 70,000 others take in daily as you ride the Staten Island Ferry. The ferry, which goes between St. George on Staten Island and Whitehall Street in Manhattan serves 22 million passengers each year. Unleash your inner Rose, and let the wind sweep through your hair.

        <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> <a href="https://www.thehighline.org/">High Line</a>
        <br>
        Walbrking the high line is always a good idea, even when the temperatures drop. Open from 7 am until 8 pm you can enjoy birdwatching on the 1.5 mile pathway. Take in the High Line’s greenery, berry filled shrubs, and native plants. The High Line boats over 200 species of perennials, trees, and grasses.

        <br>
        A delightful urban oasis, Little Island in Hudson River Park is a gem. Plants, shrubs, and rocks are the highlights and change with the seasons. It is open 365 days a year starting at 6 AM. The closing times vary with the seasons but for the winter months plan to depart by 9 PM. Head over to Pier 55 between 13th and 14th Streets to enjoy this public park where art meets nature.
