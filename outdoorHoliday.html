  The fall to winter holiday season lasts a few months in my household as our Christmas tree is put up a few weeks post Halloween and remains until after we bring in the New Year. As I am filled with the holiday spirit early on, I enjoy perusing my city to take in its natural beauty and exploring the different elements that make this time of year special in the Big Apple. 

  <br><br>
Some of my favorite outdoor holiday activities include the following: 

  <br><br>
  <i class="fa-regular fa-snowflake"></i> <a href="https://bryantpark.org/activities/bank-of-america-winter-village-at-bryant-park">Bryant Park</a> 40th-42nd and 5th Avenue
<br>
Byrant Park is the ideal spot where one can enjoy crisp November and December nights in igloos set amidst magnificent New York City skyscrapers. For those who would rather skip their gym workout routine to get some outdoor exercise both curling and ice skating are opportunities available to all. If you are lucky, you may catch a free skating show! Do not forget to sample the foods and treats at the surrounding holiday shops. 

<br><br>
<i class="fa-regular fa-snowflake"></i> <a href="https://www.nybg.org/">NY Botanical Garden</a> 2900 Southern Blvd. 
<br>
The annual holiday train show in the Bronx is a must-see for all ages. Set both outdoors as well as indoors in the Haupt Conservatory, this impressive display of locomotives is perfect in either the day or the night. While you are there you can participate in a variety of holiday crafts or classes from botanical card making to harvest tabletop designs.

<br><br>
<i class="fa-regular fa-snowflake"></i> <a href="https://www.bbg.org/">Brooklyn Botanical Garden</a>n 150 Eastern Parkway
<br>
Not to be confused with the NY Botanical Garden in the Bronx, Brooklyn Botanic Garden also offers a stunning outdoor light display. With Brooklyn’s “Lightscape” spectators can be immersed in art, music, and nature under the colorful installation. The garden even offers value night tickets for a significant cost savings. 
<br><br>

<i class="fa-regular fa-snowflake"></i> <a href="https://www.centralpark.com/things-to-do/attractions/wollman-rink/#google_vignette">Wollman Rink</a> 59th between 5th and 6th Avenue
<br>
Most know it as the location of the annual Spence Ice Skating party, but Wollman Rink is open now for ice skating in Central Park. One can rent skates and lockers as well as take lessons. Don’t forget to get some hot chocolate too. 

<br><br>
Season's greetings to all!
