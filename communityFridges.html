        Community refrigerators have been popping up around NYC over the past few years. As the food insecure population increases, these fridges provide free food resources for vulnerable individuals and families on an anonymous basis. Additionally, the fridges aim to reduce waste while helping unite the food equity community. Many of these refrigerators operate on a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week basis. 
        <br><br>
        If you want to join the fight against food insecurity, please check out the following programs:
        <br><br>
        <b>  1. Grassroots Grocery (NYCHA Holmes Towers 1780 1st Avenue at East 92nd Street)        </b>

        <br><br>
        This program is super flexible and provides volunteers with tasks that can easily be done at anytime. After one signs up as a volunteer they can help by:
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;- Donating food to fill up the fridge on the Upper East Side. According to its website, the organization accepts “donations of &nbsp;&nbsp;fresh produce, nonexpired unopened nonperishable goods, and dated/labeled single-serving prepared food in see-through  containers.” 
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;- Supporting refrigerator cleaning efforts
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;- Picking up and delivering food from local businesses or organizations to the fridge
        <br><br>

        This organization, One Love Community Fridge, is helping community members across all ages to gain “access to fresh foods, nutrition education, and sustainability” as it combats the stigma surrounding hunger and malnutrition. In addition to food pick-ups or deliveries, one can volunteer to assist with maintaining fridges as well as fundraising.

        <b> 3. In Our Hearts (over 172 locations across NYC)  </b>
