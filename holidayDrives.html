  With the winter months approaching, many in our city struggle to find the basic necessities to prepare for the cold temperatures. Given the increase in asylum seekers in our area, it is more crucial than ever to help those in need. Whether you organize a clothing drive for a club at Spence; volunteer to buy gifts for those under-resourced in your community; or spearhead a food drive in your apartment building, your efforts will be greatly appreciated by those who really need the resources.    
  <br><br>

  If you want to lead a drive this holiday season, please check out the following programs - 
  <br><br>
  
  <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i><a href="https://www.newyorkcares.org/coat-drive">New York Cares</a>: The annual New York Cares coat drive aims to motivate community members to collect and distribute warm coats of all sizes to New Yorkers experiencing hardships. Whether you contribute money or organize a collection drive, just know that you will help keep someone warm this winter. Additionally, the organization always needs volunteers to sort collected coats. 
  
  <br><br>
  <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i><a href="https://nycommonpantry.org/charitable-drives-and-activities/">NY Common Pantry</a>: One may think of the NY Common Pantry as an organization solely providing necessities for food insecure populations, however, the group does so much more. In the holiday season, you can help with their winter coat drive, Thanksgiving food drive, and toy drive. In January and February, the NY Common Pantry has a pasta bowl to collect boxes of dry pasta products. 
  
  <br><br>
  <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i><a href="https://www.uocnyc.org/">Urban Outreach Center of NYC</a>: Right on the Upper East Side, this center aims to end the hunger gap and accepts monetary donations as well as food, clothing, and hygiene items. Their mission is to help those vulnerable in our city with dignity. If you want to make an impact, propose a drive idea today. 
  <br><br>
  
  <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i><a href="https://www.bowery.org/donate/donate-goods/">The Bowery Mission</a>: This organization accepts donations of food, clothing, and essential items on a year-round basis. In terms of food, the greatest needs are grab and go meals, pre-packaged snacks, canned goods, water bottles, spices, cooking oil, utensils, and sauces. If clothing donations work for you then help out by collecting men’s and women’s jeans, outerwear, shoes, socks, and professional clothing in sizes medium through XXXL. Other items needed include twin sheets, bath towels, hygiene products (travel size, brand new), and blankets.
