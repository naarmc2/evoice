  Coffee. Anywhere you walk in the Spence building, whether it is up the townhouse staircases or in the small back hallway of the QSA, coffee is deeply ingrained in Spence culture. Especially with the proximity of popular coffee shops such as Blank Street and Starbucks, coffee is not just a means of keeping one caffeinated and energized for the day, but has become a key way for bonding with fellow students. Personally, the meaning behind spending a slightly questionable amount of money on Blank Street is to feel unity with my peers. I love going on coffee excursions with my friends and being able to bond with classmates I am not so close with over our favorite Blank Street orders. Particularly since Arina and I were both new students at Spence starting in 9th grade, and being initially unfamiliar with a lot of students, going to Blank Street for the first time was seen as a staple to becoming fully immersed in Spence culture.

  Indeed, getting coffee is a way of socializing, whether it’s a brisk walk to Blank Street with some friends or meeting a classmate/teacher in the store and having a chat while waiting for your order. It’s a casual and quick little break in a stressful, academic-heavy day, so it serves as a fun way to hang out with friends even in a limited amount of time. Moreover, the cozy vibe of the Blank Street store provides a perfect space for a friendly little chat. Often, there will be some Spence students and even teachers in the store, and having a quick chat with an old classmate or teacher who you haven’t spoken to for a long time is a great way to connect with them again. As a well-loved item by the Spence community, coffee also encourages socialization by providing a topic of discussion. When meeting new friends, asking about their favourite drink at a coffee shop is a great way to start a conversation.

  Personally, Blank Street holds a special place in Arina and I’s friendship as it was one of the ways we bonded in Spence Start, where both of us were new to the Spence community in 9th grade. As a non-NYC native, I wanted to experience both Spence and the city’s culture for the first time. Knowing our shared interest towards matcha, Arina offered to take me to a nearby Blank Street. As we sipped our iced white chocolate matchas and sat on the chic wooden bench that crisp September day, we chatted about a range of subjects and bonded over our nervousness and excitement of starting high school. Even today, coffee is still a quintessential part of our friendship. Whether it is trying and failing to get into the Blank Street regulars program, or sprinting back to class after miscalculating the wait time to get a coffee, Blank Street has shaped our friendship with the numerous memories it has created. The store, with its faux plants at the register and the warm yellow-tinted lights, has become a hub of its own, fostering bonds that will last beyond the red doors.
