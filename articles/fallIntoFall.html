       With this incredibly long stretch of warm, sunny weather it is almost hard to forget that we are officially in the season of fall! Green leaves have started to change into hues of orange, red, and brown as the nights cool down. Here are my favorite local spots to view fall foliage:
      <br><br>
      <b>Central Park</b> - The Mall in Central Park is hard to beat on a fall day. Located in the middle of the park between 66-72 Streets one can experience the beauty of the many magical American elms. The Ramble which is between 73-78 Streets is my second favorite space to take in the golden leaves.
      <br><br>
      <b>Fort Tryon Park</b> - Copper hues in the autumn fill this hidden gem of a park in New York City that spans Riverside Drive to Broadway between West 192nd and Dyckman Street. My first introduction to Fort Tryon Park was on a visit to view medieval art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s museum called The Cloisters. The Met Cloisters is nestled in Fort Tryon Park making for an interesting mix of nature, architecture, and art. 
      <br><br>
      <b>Van Cortlandt Park</b> - Located in the northwest Bronx, Van Cortlandt Park boats over 1,000 acres with colorful mature trees that canopy the landscape. From oak to maple to hickory to tuliptrees, visitors can hike the trails and take in an assortment of abundant tree species.

      Happy leaf peeping this fall!
