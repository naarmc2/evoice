  Although I have reduced my caffeine intake this spring, I still enjoy a specialty beverage once in a while. I am not one to splurge on expensive varieties, so I have uncovered a few hidden gems on the East Side that are worth a trip and are easy on the wallet. Some fantastic finds include: 
  <br><br>
  <a href="https://www.reminyc.com/">REMI Flower & Coffee </a>
  <br>
  906 Second Avenue
  <br>
  REMI offers customers the opportunity to buy beautiful flower arrangements, cafe drinks, and baked goods all at once. If you have the time, sit by the vase arrangements and try one of their lavender lattes. 

  <br><br>
  <a href="https://www.787coffee.com/best-coffee-shop-in-new-york">787 Coffee</a>
  <br>
  228 East 80th Street
  <br>
  Touted as some of Puerto Rico's finest coffee, 787 Coffee locations provide unique caffeine offerings that satisfy all tastes. A real crowd pleaser is its coquito latte which is a blend of coconut, cinnamon, and a double shot of espresso. Another delight is the dulce de leche latte.

  <a href="https://www.pickybarista.com/">Picky Barista</a>
  <br>
  1220 Lexington Avenue
  <br>
  You may think you are in Europe when you enter Picky Barista. This family owned coffee shop provides several variations of coffee drinks as well as chai, turmeric, and matcha lattes. If you need more than a beverage try their overnight oats or nutella croissants.
