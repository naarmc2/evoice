  As Upper Schoolers approach the work-filled spring months, they all are looking for a way to unwind. Luckily, the list of New York City’s 2025 upcoming concerts is set to be one of the strongest in years, with major artists in multiple genres hitting the stage. Here’s an overview of some of the most popular artists coming to NYC this year, and a little about their expected performances!

  <br><br><span class="material-symbols-outlined">celebration</span> Tyler, the Creator - The Chromakopia Tour
  <br><br>

  After a short break from touring, Tyler, the Creator is back, and his fans are in for an amazing performance. Tyler started his tour earlier in February of 2025, and will be performing alongside artists Lil Yachty and Paris Texas. Tyler has recently become popular on social media for songs like Sticky, Like Him, and See You Again. He will be coming to Madison Square Garden and the Barclays Center in July, and his audience should be prepared for his chaotic energy, well-crafted visuals, and unpredictable setlist. 


  <br><span class="material-symbols-outlined">celebration </span> Beyoncé - Cowboy Carter Tour
  <br><br>

  On the morning of the Grammys, Beyoncé announced her Cowboy Carter tour. Fresh off winning another Grammy (because, of course she did), Beyoncé is bringing her new country music era to the stage. The MetLife Stadium dates will likely be amazing, but at this point, it’s not just about the performance: it’s about the statement. As Renaissance represented dance music, Cowboy Carter represents a deep dive into country, and, more importantly, into who gets to claim what in music history.

  <span class="material-symbols-outlined">celebration </span> The Weeknd - After Hours Till Dawn Tour 
  <br><br>

  The Weeknd's stadium run will begin in 2025, this time with the final installment of his After Hours trilogy, Hurry Up Tomorrow. The June MetLife stadium shows are already shaping up to be one of the biggest of the summer, with Playboi Carti and Mike Dean as opener. However, this tour represents more than just a performance: it might be The Weeknd’s last. As fans speculate that Hurry Up Tomorrow could be his final album, they might be witnessing the end of his music era in real time. While The Weeknd is still figuring out where he stands in the art and music industry, the show will definitely be one to remember. 

  <br><span class="material-symbols-outlined">celebration</span> Nine Inch Nails - Peel It Back Tour
  <br><br>


  Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are back in NYC for their first performance here in years. The Peel It Back album has gained a large amount of traction, leading to the group adding a second date at the Barclays Center due to overwhelming demand. The NYC stop in September is going to be very loud and intense, but especially iconic.


  <span class="material-symbols-outlined">celebration</span>Deftones - Lonely People With Power Tour 
    <br><br> 

  Alternative metal legends Deftones are bringing their Lonely People With Power tour to Madison Square Garden in April. Known for their passionate yet crushing sound, Deftones’ live shows are an experience that balances aggression with beauty. Deftones’ music has been popular on social media since 2021, and they have gained fans through all areas of social media. With Gatecreeper and Trauma Ray opening, this performance is going to be heavy, powerful, and hotblooded.

  NYC's 2025 lineup is packed, but it's also a reflection of where music is heading. Some artists are still defining their legacy, others are already cemented in it, and a few are just trying to reconstruct their identities by starting over. Either way, these shows are worth being there for.
