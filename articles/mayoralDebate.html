        The NYC mayoral election is occurring on November 4th and has been named the most significant local race currently happening in the country, considering the city's cultural and economic influence. The fact that current mayor Eric Adams dropped out of the race only five weeks before election day and the uniqueness of a young Democratic Socialist beating former governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary now leading in the polls heightens public attention. The first debate of the general election took place on Thursday, October 16th. Below you will find short biographies of each of the candidates, and what I thought was the best point they made.

        <br><br>
        <b>  Democratic Candidate: <a href="https://www.zohranfornyc.com/platform">Zohran Mamdani</a></b>
        <br><br>
        Zohran Mamdani is a New York State Assembly Member who identifies as a Democratic Socialist. Mamdani was born in Uganda, raised in New York, and attended Bronx High School of Science. His main goal if elected is to lower the cost of living in NYC by freezing rent in rent stabilized apartments, making buses fast and free, creating no cost childcare, and establishing city-owned grocery stores. To fund his plans, he would raise the corporate tax rate from 8.85% to 11.5% and add an additional 2% on income tax for New Yorkers earning more than 1 million dollars.
        <br><br>
        Best point made during the debate: When the candidates were asked about how they would handle the crime issue in New York City, Mamdani stated that he would work to ensure faster NYPD response times (comparing how you have minute-by-minute updates on your takeout food on UberEats but no updates when 911 is called). He would also create a group of social workers that work with the NYPD to improve mental health problems.

        <b>        Independent Candidate: <a href="https://www.andrewcuomo.com/about">Andrew Cuomo</a></b>
        <br><br>
        Andrew Cuomo served as the attorney general of New York from 2006-2010 and governor of New York from 2011-2021. Cuomo was born and raised in Queens and attended Archbishop Molloy High School. Some of his goals if elected are to ensure high-quality education in public schools, expand the size of the NYPD, increase enforcement of small crimes, make subways safer, combat antisemitism, expand the second avenue subway line, and create more affordable housing. 
        <br><br>
        Best point made during the debate: When talking about rent and affordability, Mamdani emphasized his plan to freeze the rent for rent stabilized apartments, but Cuomo pointed out that freezing the rent only postpones the rent. He also highlighted that the expenses of landlords need to be considered when making that decision.

        <b>Republican Candidate: <a href="Curtis Sliwa">Curtis Sliwa</a></b>
        <br><br>
        Curtis Sliwa is the founder of the Guardian Angels, a crime prevention organization. Sliwa was born and raised in Canarsie, Brooklyn and attended Bildersee Junior High School. Some of his goals if elected are to work with the New York City Council to reform constituent services, hire more NYPD, crack down on crime, improve student outcomes and attendance, restore local zoning control, lower transportation costs, improve safety conditions at Rikers island, and reinstate homeless outreach units.
        <br><br>
Best point made during the debate: When the candidates were asked the question “Will you be a mayor to all?”, while Cuomo and Mamdani used the time to point out the flaws in each other and if they thought the other showed support to both Jews and Muslims, Sliwa pointed out that neither had mentioned the Asian hate spike in 2020. He also argued that neither of them did anything to advocate for Asians during that period or had even mentioned them at all when answering the question.
