        Statistically speaking, more than half of US teens spend an average of 7 hours and 22 minutes daily on screen time, with more than 4.5 hours specifically spent on social media. As students enter high school, having self control over phone-use is the fundamental step in ensuring devotion to academics and extracurriculars. Though most students understand this rather cliche idea of phone control, few do so in a persistent or effective way. If you often find yourself constantly wanting to check your phone while doing homework despite knowing you should be focusing, then this article is for you!

        As a senior, I have accumulated some great study habits specifically regarding phone use during my high school experience that are actually effective and encourage persistence over time. For people who have relatively weak self control regarding phones like me, the best way to resolve this issue is physical isolation. For example, having your phone in another room or simply somewhere in your room where you can't reach with a single grab is highly effective in promoting focus. Oftentimes, as someone who has low self-control on phones, I can’t trust myself mentally to focus, so the best resolution is to physically put my phone somewhere where I can't access it easily while studying.

        According to psychological studies, people usually hold back or procrastinate from doing certain tasks that they think are going to take up a lot of energy. Therefore, an alternate solution to phone control is to install screen time controls or apps that physically lock down access to your phone whilst studying. This way, you don't actually have to leave your room and put your phone away; a simple click on your phone will spur a lock-down, thus reducing the idea of the “energy” that it's going to take to actually start studying. Some great applications I suggest for phone lock-downs are Apple's Screen Time and Forest.

        Building these studying habits over time not only boosts your high school performance and helps you focus on all kinds of tasks, but it also results in more motivation and joy while studying. Be sure to try out these habits the next time you study!
