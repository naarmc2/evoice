  Valentine’s Day (or Galentine’s Day) is a few days away and you might be temped by the vibrant colors of latex balloons or the oversized heart cards at retail stores. Fight that temptation and help our environment this holiday season. One can buy (or make) a gift that is friendly to the Earth to show their love.     
  <br><br>

  A few ideas for you to consider include - 
  <br><br>

  <i class="fa-regular fa-heart"></i> Potted plants: Forgo the pre-cut fresh flowers and buy (or plant) something that will last. Your recipient is surely to remember your kind gesture every time they look at the long-lasting greenery. 
  <br> <br>

  <i class="fa-regular fa-heart"></i> Make dinner: Instead of dining out on Valentine’s Day, shop for locally sourced food items and make a holiday dinner that is healthy, less expensive, and farm-to-table. From produce to herbs to spices, you can create a beautiful meal with fresh ingredients. Don’t forget the candles! 

  <br><br>
  <i class="fa-regular fa-heart"></i> Used Books: Have you been to a thrift store recently? If so, you may have noticed many brand new or almost new books available for purchase for only a few dollars. Lessen your carbon footprint by walking to your local thrift store today instead of online ordering a new book. 
  <br><br>

  <i class="fa-regular fa-heart"></i> Create cards: You can use cardboard boxes or inserts as the base of your creative holiday cards. Decorate them with paint, markers, stickers, glitter, sequins, fabric, pom poms, buttons, felt, construction paper, ribbons, magazine clippings, or anything else you have on hand. Your personal touch will speak volumes. 

  <br><br>
  The planet loves you!
