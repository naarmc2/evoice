        Climate change is ruining the environment, wars rampage across the Earth. Corruption, arson, school shootings. It seems that today, we are bombarded by all kinds of bad news. We see it everywhere too. Social media reels divulge into the latest mass consumption microtrend or a quick look at your news feed will be met with dozens of “bad news” headlines just from today. This bias is wired in our brains - according to a BBC article, humans have a strong “negativity bias,” where we collectively respond more and remember bad news. However, despite this psychological tendency, it is also important to note the good things in life. After all, constant exposure to bad news can trigger a fight-or-flight response, leading to increased anxiety, stress, and even depression. Therefore, eVoice presents to you recent good news:


        Swiss Women Set a Global Precedent for Challenging their Nation's Climate Efforts


        A group of 2,400 elderly Swiss women successfully fought against their government’s “woefully inadequate” climate change actions, demanding accelerated emission cuts. Taken to the European Court of Human Rights, the court ruled that Switzerland’s inadequate climate measures violated the European Convention on Human Rights, specifically the right to private and family life due to the serious adverse effects of climate change. This became the first time in history that global warming had been linked to human rights and the first climate change case to be heard by an international human rights court - a truly momentous landmark. These ramifications impact not just Switzerland: Belgium, Germany, and Poland are already being challenged for a lack of climate change protection. European states are being held responsible for their inhabitants, leading to improved health, safety, and wellness for those living there. 


        Illinois Launched the First Legal Helpline in the United States for LGBTQ+ Residents


        Due to the recent shutdown of the National Suicide and Crisis lifeline for LGBTQ+ youth under the Trump administration in July, Illinois launched the country’s first helpline providing support for the LGBTQ+ community. The helpline, called Illinois Pride Connect, provides aid in the housing, health care, and government benefit sector, and is available in English or Spanish. In partnership with Chicago nonprofit Legal Council for Health, this helpline gained $250,000 in state funding and $100,000 in philanthropic support. This is a great step forward for protecting the mental and physical health of the LGBTQ+ community, and could become a framework for other states to follow suit.
