  We've all had hectic school weeks, where we are battling between 3 tests, 2 quizzes, and in-class writing all in the same week. I have certainly found myself struggling during those busy weeks resorting to cramming for some of my assessments when time is tight. While this last-minute study method might help me memorize concepts temporarily, I've discovered it falls short where it truly matters: long-term retention. Though cramming might save the day for tomorrow's test, it rarely builds the lasting knowledge we ultimately need. 
  <br><br>     
  Most Spence students seem to agree. According to a school-wide survey asking students if they have crammed for an assessment this year, an astounding 83% of participants said yes. For those who replied yes, 68% of them didn‚Äôt retain the information they crammed as a result of the method ‚Äì a significant portion. 
  <br><br>     
  Obviously, cramming is not an ideal option so here are some suggestions for better and more active study methods to improve retaining information instead of forgetting the information immediately after a test (after all, not for school but for life we learn üß†)
  <br><br>     
  One method that I find especially useful is <a href="https://www.kpu.ca/sites/default/files/Learning%20Centres/Think_SpacedRepetition_LA.pdf" target="_blank">spaced repetition</a>, a technique where you study a topic at strategic intervals over time. This method allows you to confirm your grasp of the information before taking a deliberate break, then testing your knowledge again later to strengthen retention. I have found that Quizlet‚Äôs write mode does a great job implementing spaced repetition approach, and they have also recently enhanced its offerings with engaging new games including Blast and Blocks for a more interactive practice. 
  <br><br>     
  Secondly, creating a <a href="https://www.mindmapping.com/mind-map" target="_blank">mind map</a> of your knowledge could be an effective strategy, which allows you to visually organize and spill out all your knowledge and reveal any gaps in your thinking. This technique involves placing a central concept at the center of your page, then branching outward with connected ideas and details. For visual learners like myself, mind mapping transforms abstract information into a tangible, spatial representation that's easier to recall. It also naturally incorporates active recall ‚Äì challenging you to retrieve information from memory without prompts or hints. By forcing your brain to reconstruct connections between concepts, mind mapping strengthens neural pathways that support long-term retention far more effectively than passive review methods.

  Here are some more helpful tips from participants of the survey (thank you everyone for filling it out)!

  There are many other wonderful ways to study and prepare for your assessments that are not mentioned in this article, so I would advise you to do more research on the topic. Everyone studies in their own, unique ways, even throughout different subjects, so experimenting with many of these methods of studying can also prove beneficial. Happy studying!
