  Spring is finally here! I believe most of us would agree that this past winter was an incredibly long, cold venture. Post spring break we were (mis)treated with frigid temps and limited sun. However, in the past few weeks the cherry blossoms have canvassed the urban landscape and tulips have bloomed sprinkling our city with hues of purple, pink, red, and yellow. Some places where you can witness this annual treat include:

  <br>
  You can experience the delight from the approximately 70,000 tulip bulbs planted along Park Avenue from 56th to 96th Streets. Whether you are taking a stroll or riding a Citi Bike this is a spectacular scene that should not be missed.

  Venture over to the Upper West Side for some gorgeous tulip sightings. Specifically, the West Side Community Garden on West 89th Street between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues boasts a vibrant display of tulips from mid-April until early-May. Founded in 1976, this garden is entirely run by volunteers.

  <br>
  Mid-park around 66th Street one will find the Olmsted Flower Bed to be an ideal tulip viewing location. It was created in 1972 south of Literary Walk and annually bursts with abundant tulips each spring.

  Enjoy the tulips before they are gone!
