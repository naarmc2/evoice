        “Do you watch that influencer? Me too, I love them!!” is a phrase said many times in conversation with my friends, and is overheard in various discussions. The lives of online vloggers and creators, especially those who live in your own city, feel tangible, as much of their content is centered around activities including trying trendy food spots, working out, running errands, and debriefing popular shows. These influencers post so much of their everyday life that it makes the viewer feel that they really know the person on their screen. When perfectly curated content reaches the right target audience and demographic, a community forms. Followers might interact with the creator’s video by liking, commenting and maybe even DMing, grinning when the creator responds to them. Over lunch, friends might share thoughts on a recent scandal or share a “hot take” they have, feeling qualified to discuss because of how much content they consume.

        But what is the extent of these parasocial relationships, and what does it mean to really know someone? It’s not taken into account that social media is a highlight reel and might not accurately depict how a person acts in real life. If the most picturesque 2 minutes of your day were caught on camera, you might also look pretty perfect and productive too. 

        But a positive aspect of being a follower is the possible connections made through livestreams or in-person events with other fans of the same creator, resulting in real friendships. Brooke Miccio and Danielle Carolan, content creators and creators of the podcast Gals On The Go, host “community events” such as workout classes and live shows for this very purpose, as do many other creators. 

        If you are so focused on modeling the routines you watch and aspiring to meet the creators you adore, you might be missing out on the purpose of the content: to connect with others and learn about their day-to-day experiences, not to judge and compare your life with theirs. I always hated the saying “never meet your heroes”, so maybe it should be “never be like your heroes, be yourself” instead.
